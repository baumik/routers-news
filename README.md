Routers News
------------------

Routers is a collection of web-crawlers for various popular technology news sources.

It exposes a command-line interface to these crawlers, allowing for the distinguishing tech-news enthusiast to avoid leaving the comfort of their terminal.

It Currently Supports:

* New York Times
* Ars Technica
* USA Today
* L.A. Times
* TechCrunch
* Wired.com
* Github

It's Also An Experiment
------------

It is my hope that, by open-sourcing a collection of news scrapers, a community can be built around building a powerful set of real-time news aggregation tools.

npm install routers-news -g

Contributing
----------

It's easy to add a new news source:

* fork the routers news repo.
* check it out locally (git clone git@github.com:your-username/routers-news.git).
* run __npm install__ to install the libraries locally.
* create a new crawler in the __lib/sources__ directory (everything in this hierarchy is automatically loaded).
* to test your crawler run: __node ./bin/routers-news.js__.

You can also help a ton by:

* reporting when crawlers are broken.
* extending on the crawelrs, I'd love to have:
  * Dates.
  * Authors.
  * Better image extraction.
* improving on the CLI client.

Help make our dreams of a collaborative web-crawler a reality :)
